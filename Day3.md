## Day 3: May 14, 2025
- Project Goal: Build an AI agent to automate AWS Landing Zone deployment using Control Tower.
- Key Tools: AWS Control Tower, Amazon Bedrock, Terraform.
- My Understanding: Control Tower helps set up a secure AWS environment; Bedrock is for AI tasks.

## Goal
Verify Bedrock model access, document project requirements, learn AWS Lambda basics, and establish a remote Git repository for version control

## Deliverables
Updated project-notes.md with Bedrock status, requirements.md finalized, Lambda basics summarized, remote Git repository set up.

## Bedrock Model Access Update
- Request Submitted: May 14, 2025
- Model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Status: [Approved] as of May 15, 2025

## Project Updates
- Completed requirements.md with in-scope and out-of-scope details.

## AWS Lambda Basics
- Lambda: Serverless service to run code (e.g., Python).
- Key Features: Event-driven, integrates with Bedrock.
- Use Case: Process prompts and generate Terraform code.
- Example: Lambda triggers Bedrock when a user submits a prompt.

## AWS Console Observations
- Lambda Status: No functions yet.
- Region: us-east-1 (correct).
- Next Step: Create a function on Day 4.

## Summary of Lambda Learning
- Lambda runs serverless code, triggered by events.
- It will integrate with Bedrock for the AI agent.
- Next Step: Set up a Lambda function tomorrow.
