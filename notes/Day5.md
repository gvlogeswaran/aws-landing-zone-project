## Day 4: May 15, 2025
- Project Goal: Build an AI agent to automate AWS Landing Zone deployment using Control Tower.
- Key Tools: AWS Control Tower, Amazon Bedrock, Terraform.
- My Understanding: Control Tower helps set up a secure AWS environment; Bedrock is for AI tasks.

## Goal
Set up an AWS CodeBuild project to automate Terraform deployment, enhance the Lambda function with Terraform validation, and test a Terraform deployment locally to prepare for the Landing Zone.

## Deliverables
CodeBuild project created, Lambda function updated with validation, local Terraform deployment tested, and project-notes.md updated with progress.
