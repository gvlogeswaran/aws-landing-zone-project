## Day 2: May 14, 2025
- Project Goal: Build an AI agent to automate AWS Landing Zone deployment using Control Tower.
- Key Tools: AWS Control Tower, Amazon Bedrock, Terraform.
- My Understanding: Control Tower helps set up a secure AWS environment; Bedrock is for AI tasks.

## Goal
Build on your Day 1 foundation by learning Amazon Bedrock, requesting model access, installing Terraform, and configuring VS Code for development.

## Deliverables
Updated project-notes.md with Bedrock summary, Bedrock model access request submitted, Terraform installed, VS Code set up with extensions.

## AWS Console Observations
- Bedrock Status: Claude 3.5 access requested and it's available
- Region: us-east-1 (correct for project).

## Amazon Bedrock Basics
- Bedrock: A service for generative AI with foundation models (e.g., Claude).
- Key Features: Generates code, integrates with Lambda.
- Use Case: Will generate Terraform code for the Landing Zone.
- Example: Prompt "Generate Terraform code" â†’ Bedrock outputs code.

## Control Tower Set up
- Quickly set up and configure your AWS environment
- Apply guardrails  Enable security and complaince using established guardrails
- Get visiblity Get visual summaries of your AWS environment

## AWS Console Observations
- Control Tower Status: Not set up yet.
- Region: us-east-1 (correct for project).

## Summary of Control Tower Learning
- Control Tower helps create a secure AWS environment with multiple accounts.
- It uses guardrails to enforce rules and Account Factory to create accounts.
- Next Step: Learn how to set it up with Terraform.

## Summary of Day1
