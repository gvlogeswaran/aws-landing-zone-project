## Day 2: May 14, 2025
- Project Goal: Build an AI agent to automate AWS Landing Zone deployment using Control Tower.
- Key Tools: AWS Control Tower, Amazon Bedrock, Terraform.
- My Understanding: Control Tower helps set up a secure AWS environment; Bedrock is for AI tasks.

## Goal
Build on your Day 1 foundation by learning Amazon Bedrock, requesting model access, installing Terraform, and configuring VS Code for development.

## Deliverables
Updated project-notes.md with Bedrock summary, Bedrock model access request submitted, Terraform installed, VS Code set up with extensions.

## AWS Console Observations
- Bedrock Status: Claude 3.5 access requested and it's available
- Region: us-east-1 (correct for project).

## Amazon Bedrock Basics
- Bedrock: A service for generative AI with foundation models (e.g., Claude).
- Key Features: Generates code, integrates with Lambda.
- Use Case: Will generate Terraform code for the Landing Zone.
- Example: Prompt "Generate Terraform code" â†’ Bedrock outputs code.

## Summary of Bedrock Learning
- Bedrock is an AI service for generating content like Terraform code.
- It requires model access (e.g., Claude) and integrates with Lambda.
- Next Step: Request Claude access today.

## Bedrock Model Access
- Requested: Claude 3.5 on May 14, 2025.
- Reason: AI agent for Terraform code generation.
- Status: Access granted (Within few mins)

## Terraform Setup
- Version: Terraform v1.5.x
- Status: Installed successfully.
- Test Result: Terraform initialized and planned successfully. (Bucket created and destroyed)
